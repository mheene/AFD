In $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action it is possible to define what AFD should do
when for example some remote host is not reachable. It is possible to
then execute some script or binary program. There are five possible actions,
each have their own subdiretory in $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action, defined as
follows:

   <th>Directory</th>
   <th>Description</th>

<tr>
   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/source/info</td>
   <td>When <a href="dir_config.html#info_time">info time</a> for the given
       directory alias has been reached, the script/program with the
       directory alias as filename will be executed with the parameter
       'start'. When the warn situation is no longer valid the script/program
       is called again with the parameter 'stop'.</td>

   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/source/warn</td>
   <td>When <a href="dir_config.html#warn_time">warn time</a> for the given
       directory alias has been reached, the script/program with the
       directory alias as filename will be executed with the parameter
       'start'. When the warn situation is no longer valid the script/program
       is called again with the parameter 'stop'. In addition there will
       be warnings in the log.</td>

   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/source/error</td>
   <td>If the source directory is not accessible a script/program with the
       directory alias as filename will be executed with the parameter
       'start'. As soon as the directory is accessible again, the
       script/program is called again with the parameter 'stop'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/target/success</td>
   <td>If a script/program with the host alias as filename exists and is
       executable, this will be executed each time a file is send to
       this target.</td>

   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/target/info</td>
   <td>When <a href="host_config.html#warn_time">warn time</a> seconds
       have elapsed with no data being send to this host, the script/program
       in $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/target/info/ with the host alias as
       filename will be executed with the parameter 'start'. As soon as
       data has been send successful the script/program is called again
       with the parameter 'stop'.</td>

<tr>
   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/target/warn</td>
   <td>When <a href="host_config.html#warn_time">warn time</a> seconds
       have elapsed with no data being send to this host, the script/program
       in $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/target/warn/ with the host alias as
       filename will be executed with the parameter 'start'. As soon as
       data has been send successful the script/program is called again
       with the parameter 'stop'. In addition there will be warnings in
       the log.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/action/target/error</td>
   <td>If the error counter for a given host has reached
       <a href="host_config.html#max_errors">max errors</a>
       <a href="edit_hc.html#max_errors">(edit_hc)</a>, then the script/program
       with the host alias as filename will be executed with the parameter
       As soon as the error counter is below max errors the script/program
       is called again with the parameter 'stop'.</td>
</tr>

</p>
<p>
Instead of having a action file for each source/target it is also possible
to put into the directory a script/program with the name 'all.default'. Then
the action will be done for all source/target entities. It is also possible
to use both method, then if a separate script/program s found, this will be
taken and not 'all.default'. If the 'all.default' script/program is called,
it is always called with the alias name (of the host or directory ) as a
second parameter.
