The afd_info dialog shows information on a specified host. This information
is stored in an ASCII text file which must be in the directory
$AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/info. This file must have the following name:
&lt;hostname&gt; or if you want to place it in a central file
it must be in $AFD_WORK_DIR/etc/<a href="host_info.html">host.info</a>.
Any changes in this file will be shown immediately. The other information
is described in the following table:
