This dialog is used to configure the destination host. It will also
allow one to change the ordering of the host names in the afd_ctrl
dialog by simply dragging and dropping a selected host name. It is
only possible to have one of this dialog open at the same time.

       it is possible to have two addresses for a single host. The
       second host is always regarded as the secondary host. The user
       may can change to the secondary host or main host by pressing
       the <a href="afd_ctrl.html#Switch_host">Switch host button</a>.
       In the Host 1 and Host 2 fields characters can be entered that
       distinguish the two hosts from each other. The character will
       be appended to the end of the alias host name.</td>

       the local /etc/hosts file or the name server. If a secondary host
       is available, the second host field will be active. When the toggle
       button at the bottom of this boxed is set and the active real hostname

       it matches any of the entries in <a href="local_interface.html">

       You may specify as many user and password elements as you want, each one
       must however be separated by a ;. If you only put a $U followed
       directly by a ; it will take the user name from the recipient
       entry. The same goes for the password. If the remote server
       requires the ACCT (account) directive instead of the USER
       to enter the login name you may also use $A instead of $U.</td>
